This repository contains my eﬀort to be competitive in predicting in the dengue forecasting competition, DengAI, hosted by DrivenData. I used the competition as a capstone project in the Professional Certiﬁcate in Data Science course hosted on EDX by HarvardX.

# This repository includes the following documents:

* [The analysis: (DengAI.pdf)] (/DengAI.pdf)
* [The R scripts with the exploratory data analysis and the model (dengai-code.R)] (/dengai-code.R))
* [The markdown file which created the pdf (DengAI.Rmd)] (/DengAI.Rmd)
